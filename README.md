# CS330 - Computational Graphics and Visualization

Built realistic, interactive three-dimensional objects through the use of application programming interface (API) libraries.

Below is a questionnaire required for coursework:

Note: Uploading the entire .zip archive was not allowed as it was too large. I have uploaded the Source.cpp instead

1.	How do I approach designing software? 
I approach designing software by the same method as any other task, look at the desired end result and then backwards build and identify the methods needed to get to that result.

o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I was previously completely alien to the 3d space, and now am slightly more familiar with it.

o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a simple task oriented design process. 

o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I would better manage my goals, as I got side tracked multiple times by unnecessarily trying to add or change things that were not required.

2.	How do I approach developing programs? 
I approach developing programs the same as the software design question above.

o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Re-use of existing objects was key.

o	How did iteration factor into your development?
As I worked on my designs, I simplified and then iterated them more than once to speed up the process.

o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
It was a much different approach with this class, as I had to learn and find out all of the 3D details on my own. 

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
It will provide me with a solid career, with hopefully multiple opportunities and ensure my lifestyle with be one less frivolous with hardships.

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I directly will take the skills learned from this class, into this upcoming week in my attempts at learning Unity.
